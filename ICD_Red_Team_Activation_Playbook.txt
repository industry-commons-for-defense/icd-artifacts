# ICD Red Team Activation Playbook

**Version 1.0 – May 2025**

## Purpose

To standardize the initiation, execution, and reporting process for red-team evaluations of ICD-governed components.

## Activation Triggers

- Scheduled compliance check
- Anomaly in model behavior or component performance
- Coalition partner request for validation
- Incident reported to ICD audit ledger

## Red-Team Scope

- Software: input fuzzing, logic manipulation, exploit search
- Models: adversarial prompt injection, latent behavior triggering
- Hardware: firmware backdoors, tamper testing
- Data: poisoning detection, integrity drift

## Execution Protocol

1. Independent operator team with no development conflict
2. Logging of all tests in secure audit enclave
3. Report delivered with exploit severity classification
4. Remediation window (typically 14–30 days)

## Follow-Up

Findings requiring immediate escalation trigger ICD Steering Body notification. Tier 0 component breaches result in automatic override eligibility.
