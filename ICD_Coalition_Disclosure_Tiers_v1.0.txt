# ICD Coalition Disclosure Tiers

**Version 1.0 – May 2025**

---

## 1. Purpose

To define tiered disclosure categories for sharing ICD-governed components with allied and coalition partners. This framework balances mission interoperability with national security and export control compliance.

---

## 2. Disclosure Tier Definitions

### Tier 0 – U.S. Only (Restricted)

- Shareable only with U.S. Government entities and cleared U.S. contractors  
- Includes classified model weights, hardware schematics, and ITAR-critical datasets

### Tier 1 – Five Eyes

- Shareable with FVEY nations (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)  
- Must pass ICD security review and metadata tagging for ITAR/EAR compliance  
- Redacted lineage or component substitution allowed to enable release

### Tier 2 – NATO-Aligned

- Shareable with NATO partners participating in joint programs or mission sets  
- Requires partner-side attestation of secure handling and firewall isolation  
- Access granted at modular interface or output level only (not full internals)

### Tier 3 – Strategic Coalition Partners

- Case-by-case disclosure to non-NATO strategic allies (e.g., Japan, Israel)  
- Requires additional DoD review and releasability approval  
- Controlled sandboxed access for testing, validation, or feedback loops only

### Tier 4 – Open Global Release

- Fully unclassified, SBOM-compliant, and license-verified components  
- Publicly shareable under open-source or ICD-compatible dual licensing  
- No restrictions on educational, humanitarian, or low-risk dual-use dissemination

---

## 3. Implementation and Tagging

Each CRDS or HRDS must declare:

```yaml
coalition_disclosure_tier: [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
tier_rationale: >
  Narrative justification based on classification, operational dependency, or partner integration plan.
disclosure_approver: [DOD Office or ICD Certification Authority role]
```

---

## 4. Controls and Revocation

- Tiers may be escalated or revoked based on partner behavior, breach, or geopolitical change  
- Override powers apply for urgent mission conditions  
- Violations recorded in Federated Audit Ledger and may affect ICD trust status

---

## 5. Review Cycle

- Disclosure tiering policy reviewed annually by ICD Steering Body  
- Proposals for new partner tier creation must follow RFC process with 2/3 vote
