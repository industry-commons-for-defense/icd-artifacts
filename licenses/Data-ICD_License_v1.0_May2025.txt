# Data Industry Commons for Defense (Data-ICD) License

**Version 1.0.1 – December 2024**

---

## 1. Purpose

The Data-ICD License governs the use, sharing, and protection of data assets contributed to or generated within the Industry Commons for Defense (ICD). It ensures secure, traceable, and lawful handling of datasets, particularly in high-risk national security applications.

---

## 2. Scope

This license applies to:
- Raw datasets and structured data tables
- Preprocessed, labeled, or synthetic datasets
- Data used in model training, validation, or evaluation
- Embedded data in sensor streams or telemetry
- Government-furnished, contractor-collected, or partner-shared datasets

---

## 3. Rights Granted

Contributors grant to the U.S. Government and ICD-aligned entities:
- **Non-exclusive rights** to use, copy, preprocess, and annotate data within the ICD ecosystem
- **Right to train and fine-tune models** using the data for ICD-aligned purposes
- **Right to redistribute** data subject to classification, releasability, and contributor-specified restrictions

---

## 4. Data Rights Assertions

Contributors retain all rights to their original contributions and may assert data rights at their discretion when delivering to the U.S. Government. The ICD framework operates independently of federal acquisition data rights categories, enabling both business-to-business collaboration and government delivery.

For industry participants:
- Contributors maintain exclusive rights to their specific contributions as tracked in the ICD Metadata Schema
- Derivative works must identify constituent components per the Data Bill of Materials (DBOM)
- Rights to integrated systems are determined by the collective rights of individual components

For government deliverables:
- Data developed with government funding may carry unlimited rights per applicable regulations
- Mixed-funding scenarios allow negotiated rights assertions per 10 U.S.C. § 3458
- Privately-developed contributions may assert restricted rights as negotiated

## 5. Required Disclosures

Each dataset must include:
- A complete **Data Bill of Materials (DBOM)**  
- Source attribution and licensing history  
- Provenance and chain of custody declarations  
- Classification and dissemination markings, if applicable  
- Declaration of any foreign data collection platforms or services used

---

## 6. Data Integrity and Security

All data must:
- Be scanned for known poisoning, backdoors, or hallucination risks  
- Include validation hashes and lineage logs  
- Be segregated by sensitivity level (e.g., Unclassified, CUI, SECRET)  
- Comply with DoDI 5200.48 and EO 13556 for CUI protection

---

## 7. Foreign-Origin Disclosure Clause

Any data with partial or full foreign origin (collection, processing, or platform) must:
- Be tagged explicitly in the DBOM  
- Undergo sovereign security review  
- Be flagged for adversarial contamination potential

---

## 8. Emergency Use Clause

During national emergencies or wartime:
- The U.S. Government may extract, replicate, or redistribute any ICD-governed data  
- Commercial constraints or embargoes are automatically suspended for defense purposes  
- ICD Steering Body will oversee emergency data redistribution and operationalization

---

## 9. Compatibility

The Data-ICD License is designed to interoperate with:
- Creative Commons (CC BY, CC0)  
- Open Data Commons licenses  
- ICD Model and Software licenses  
- U.S. Government Purpose Rights and DFARS clauses

---

## 10. Violations and Enforcement

Violations may trigger:
- Data rights clawback  
- Declassification of hidden proprietary formats  
- Disqualification from ICD data handling roles  
- Referral to DoD legal and cybersecurity authorities

---

## 11. Jurisdiction

This license is governed by U.S. federal law and enforced by the ICD Steering Body, with escalation to relevant defense oversight bodies if necessary.
