# ICD Metadata Schema: Classification, ITAR, and Releasability

**Version 1.0 – May 2025**

---

## 1. Purpose

To define a structured, machine-readable schema for tagging ICD-governed components (software, models, hardware, data) with metadata related to classification level, export control status (ITAR/EAR), and foreign military sales (FMS) releasability.

---

## 2. Schema Fields

### 2.1 Classification Assertion

```yaml
classification_level: [U | CUI | S | TS]
classification_authority: [DOD | DOE | NATO | ORG-CODE]
derivative_classification_basis: [original | compiled | transformed]
```

- `U` – Unclassified  
- `CUI` – Controlled Unclassified Information  
- `S` – Secret  
- `TS` – Top Secret

---

### 2.2 Export Control (ITAR / EAR)

```yaml
itar_status: [EXEMPT | ITAR_CONTROLLED | EAR_CONTROLLED]
eccn_code: [e.g., 3D991, 5D002]  # Export Control Classification Number
ddtc_registration_required: [true | false]
foreign_origin_disclosure: [true | false]
```

- If `itar_status` = ITAR_CONTROLLED → DDTC oversight may apply  
- `foreign_origin_disclosure` = true if data, models, or components include foreign-collected or foreign-processed material

---

### 2.3 Releasability and FMS Flags

```yaml
releasability_status: [UNRESTRICTED | PARTNER_RESTRICTED | NOT_RELEASABLE]
fms_eligible: [true | false]
release_notes: >
  Freeform text describing releasability rationale or limitations.
releasability_authority: [Agency or role approving dissemination decision]
```

---

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

- Metadata must be included in all CRDS/HRDS submissions, embedded in project manifests, and linked to deployment registries
- YAML or JSON format preferred; embedded as part of SBOM/MBOM headers or sidecar files
- Enforced through ICD Audit Protocol and Federated Releasability Checks

---

## 4. Example (Model Component)

```yaml
component_name: "ThreatClassifier-v3"
component_type: "model"
classification_level: "CUI"
classification_authority: "DOD"
itar_status: "ITAR_CONTROLLED"
eccn_code: "5D002"
ddtc_registration_required: true
foreign_origin_disclosure: false
releasability_status: "PARTNER_RESTRICTED"
fms_eligible: false
releasability_authority: "Joint Staff J6 Disclosure Officer"
release_notes: >
  Model embeds decision logic derived from OPFOR ISR streams; not authorized for general foreign disclosure.
```
