# ICD Federated Audit Ledger Schema

**Version 1.0 – May 2025**

---

## 1. Purpose

To establish a decentralized, tamper-resistant schema for recording compliance, lineage, and security audit events across the Industry Commons for Defense (ICD) ecosystem.

The Federated Audit Ledger enables trusted auditability across government, coalition, and industry partners—without central chokepoints or proprietary control.

---

## 2. Architecture

- **Ledger Type:** Distributed append-only ledger (can be implemented using Merkle-tree based or blockchain-compatible structure)
- **Validation:** Cryptographic hash signatures and timestamping
- **Nodes:** Hosted by certified ICD audit authorities, defense primes, and coalition partners

---

## 3. Ledger Entry Schema

Each audit event must conform to the following schema:

```yaml
entry_id: UUID
timestamp: RFC3339
component_id: [UUID or registry name]
event_type: [registration | audit | red_team | violation | override | revocation]
event_description: >
  Freeform narrative of event or finding.
linked_crds: [CRDS ID(s)]
linked_hrds: [HRDS ID(s)]
linked_sbom: [hash or URI]
triggered_by: [manual | automated | external alert]
action_taken: [none | remediation | revocation | override]
classification: [U | CUI | S | TS]
signed_by: [entity + key fingerprint]
```

---

## 4. Event Types

- **registration** – New CRDS/HRDS logged  
- **audit** – Compliance audit performed  
- **red_team** – Red-team vulnerability discovery or result  
- **violation** – Confirmed license or security breach  
- **override** – Emergency protocol invocation  
- **revocation** – Certification or access revoked

---

## 5. Query and Replication

- Access by role-based API with cryptographic proof of integrity
- Replicated across secure ICD-certified nodes with quorum-based synchronization
- Readable by designated coalition members per classification markings

---

## 6. Legal and Operational Safeguards

- Operates under ICD governance with legal review from DoD OGC
- Integrity validated through zero-knowledge snapshot proofs and audit sampling
- Incident records must be retained for a minimum of 10 years

*Authorized under ICD Audit and Integrity Infrastructure Mandate*
